This repository holds the notebook `biodiversity_intactness_index.ipynb`, which aims to visualize the parts of the Phoenix subdivision of Maricopa County, Arizona with an observed decrease in biodiversity from 2017-2020. In 2021, Maricopa County was identified as the U.S. county with the most significant increase in developed land since 2001 [1]. The rapid expansion of this area has significant impacts on biodiversity and the well-being of nearby natural ecosystems. The investigation uses biodiversity intactness index (BII) data and geospatial data to highlight these changes.
